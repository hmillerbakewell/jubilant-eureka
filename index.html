            Click the word at the center of the web!
            You get one guess.
            All the words in the grid are related to the target word by a series of at most two links.
            Valid links are:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Synonyms: The two words share a meaning.</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="word">Frank</span> and <span class="word">Blunt</span>
                    both admit a variety of meanings,
                    but are directly linked because "to speak frankly" and "to speak bluntly" are synonymous.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hyper- and Hypo- nyms: One word is an example of another word.</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="word">Sublime</span> (the verb) is an example of <span class="word">Change</span>.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Each word has a fixed meaning,
            so if the word <span class="word">Frank</span> (meaning to stamp) is used as a link
            then it will always mean the act of stamping,
            and never, for example, speaking frankly.
            Any words used as linking words are also present in the grid.
        </p>
        <p>
            You get full marks for guessing the center word.
            You get half marks if your guess was one step from the center.
            You get no marks if your guess was two steps from the center.
        </p>
