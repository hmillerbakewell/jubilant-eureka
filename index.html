            Click the word at the center of the web!
            You get one guess.
            All the words in the grid are one step away from at least one other word,
            but only the target word is within two steps of all the others.
            Valid steps are:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Synonyms: The two words share a meaning.</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="word">Frank</span> and <span class="word">Blunt</span>
                    both admit a variety of meanings,
                    but are directly linked because "to speak frankly" and "to speak bluntly" are synonymous.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Hyper- and Hypo- nyms: One word is an example of another word.</p>
                <p>
                    A <span class="word">Pug</span> is an example of a <span class="word">Dog</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While a <span class="word">Pug</span> is therefore also an example of a <span
                        class="word">Canine</span>,
                    because a <span class="word">Dog</span> is an example of a <span class="word">Canine</span>,
                    going from <span class="word">Pug</span> to <span class="word">Canine</span> would have to go via <span class="word">Dog</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Words in the grid have fixed meanings, so if 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You get full marks for guessing the center word.
            You get half marks if your guess was one step from the center.
            You get no marks if your guess was two steps from the center.
